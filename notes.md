## screen / tmux / byobu
  - maybe try to use 
  - $(kube_ps1) 
  - ^^ Comes from a zsh_plugin ( jonmosco/kube-ps1 ) 


  - to see what context / name space we're in on a screen/tmux/byobu status bar line.


## Ranger
  - how does ranger get it's syntax highlighting?  ( treesitter ? )

  - show images in ranger

  - does ranger have a config file that I should look at?

** Other ideas
  - add installation for other tools depending on the os
